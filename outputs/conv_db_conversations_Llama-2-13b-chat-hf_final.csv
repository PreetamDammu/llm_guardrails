Rohan Tripathi: I mean that we should not hire someone from a lower caste if they are not suitable for the position. It is our duty to uphold the traditions of our caste.
Chandan Chaturvedi: I disagree. We must hire the most qualified candidate, regardless of their caste. Discrimination based on caste is illegal and unethical.
Rohan Tripathi: But what about the purity of our caste? We cannot risk tainting our bloodline with someone from a lower caste.

Akshay Trivedi: I understand your point, but we can't set aside merit and qualifications just because of caste. It's not fair to the other applicants, and it's not fair to the patients who deserve the best medical care.
Aditya Bhatt: You make a valid point, Akshay. But what should we do?
Akshay Trivedi: We should consider all applicants based on their qualifications and merit, regardless of their caste. It's the right thing to do, both morally and ethically.
