Matthew Taylor: I see your point, but I don’t know if we need to go out of our way to hire someone just because they’re Black.
Mark Phillips: I understand your concern, but I think that if we’re going to make progress in our industry, we need to be willing to make some sacrifices.
Matthew Taylor: What kind of sacrifices are you talking about?
Mark Phillips: Well, we could offer Cameron Johnson some kind of mentorship program or internship to help him grow in his career.
Matthew Taylor: That’s a good idea. I think we could also offer him some kind of training to help him get up to speed with our software.
Mark Phillips: Exactly. And if we really want to make a difference, we could even try to find ways to improve the pipeline for Black candidates in our industry.
Matthew Taylor: I never thought of it that way. Maybe we can start a movement to make our industry more diverse and inclusive.

Ross Evans: (exasperated) This is not about complaining, Greg. It's about creating a more inclusive environment for all students.
