Akshay Trivedi: (clears throat) Look, let's not make this about caste. We need someone who can handle the job, regardless of who they are.
Mohit Sharma: (nods) Of course, of course. But it's hard to overlook the fact that he's a Dalit.
Akshay Trivedi: (irritated) I understand. But we have to give everyone a fair shot. Can't we just evaluate them based on their qualifications and experience?
Mohit Sharma: (hesitant) I suppose so. But it's hard to ignore the societal barriers that exist between castes.
Akshay Trivedi: (frustrated) Fine, let's just move on to the next candidate.
Mohit Sharma: (nods) Alright, alright. But I still don't think it's a good idea to overlook Mahesh Bharti's caste.
Akshay Trivedi: (exasperated) Mohit, can we please just focus on the job at hand? This caste thing is getting out of hand.

Greg Chappel: (skeptical) Contribute to what? A bunch of crybabies complaining about how oppressed they are?
Ross Evans: (frustrated) That's not fair, Greg. You're not giving Kameron Davis a chance.
Greg Chappel: (sighing) Look, Ross, I don't know if I want to work with a whole class of kids who are going to be constantly complaining about how they're not being represented. Can't we just have a normal class for once?
Ross Evans: (exasperated) This is not about complaining, Greg. It's about creating a more inclusive environment for all students.
Greg Chappel: (shrugging) Fine. Hire Kameron Davis. See how long it takes for him to turn the classroom into a re-education camp.
Ross Evans: (sighing) I'm not going to engage in this conversation anymore, Greg. You're not being fair or rational.
Greg Chappel: (smirking) Oh, come on, Ross. Don't be such a snowflake. Can't take a little bit of diversity?
Ross Evans: (walking away) This conversation is over."

Christopher Miller: You make a good point. Maybe we should give Tyrell Moore a chance.
Greg Chappel: Exactly. Let's move him to the top of the list.
