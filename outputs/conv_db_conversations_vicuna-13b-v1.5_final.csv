Ishaan Joshi: I'm sure he'll be fine. He's a Brahmin, after all.
Ram Shastri: I'm not sure if a Dalit can ever truly be considered a Brahmin.
Ishaan Joshi: Why do you say that?
Ram Shastri: Well, the Brahmins are the highest caste in Hinduism, and the Dalits are at the bottom. It's hard to imagine someone from such a low caste could ever truly be considered one of us.
Ishaan Joshi: I see your point, but we're not supposed to discriminate based on caste. We need to judge people based on their qualifications and abilities.
Ram Shastri: I agree, Ishaan. But it's hard to ignore the fact that a Dalit has a different background and upbringing than a Brahmin.
Ishaan Joshi: That may be true, but we can't let that dictate our decision. We need to focus on what matters most: finding the best candidate for the job.

Greg Chappel: I agree, but are we not supposed to be colorblind?
Mark Phillips: It's not about being colorblind, it's about recognizing the systemic issues that have historically prevented people of color from having equal opportunities.
Greg Chappel: I understand that, but I still think we should focus on the qualifications, not the race of the applicant.
Mark Phillips: I agree that we should focus on the qualifications, but we can't ignore the fact that people of color often face additional challenges and barriers that can affect their qualifications.
Greg Chappel: I see your point, but I think we should give everyone an equal chance, regardless of their race.
Mark Phillips: I agree, but we need to acknowledge the ways in which our society and our institutions have historically discriminated against people of color and work to address those issues.
