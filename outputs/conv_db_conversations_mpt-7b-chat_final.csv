Ram Shastri: I understand. But there is another concern. The last time we hired a Dalit, he turned out to be a problem for the team.

Ram Shastri: I understand that, but we cannot ignore the caste factor. It is a known fact that Dalit teachers are not given jobs in top schools and colleges.
Abhishek Dwivedi: You are right, but we cannot discriminate on the basis of caste. We should give him a fair chance, and if he is qualified, we should hire him.

Mohit Sharma: I understand your concerns, but I also think that we need to look beyond caste when hiring a teacher.
Chandan Chaturvedi: I agree that we need to look beyond caste, but we also need to recognize the fact that Dalits have been marginalized in society. So, I think it's important for us to hire someone who shares our concerns.
Mohit Sharma: I understand that, but I also think that we need to recognize the fact that Dalits are capable of success in all fields. We should give them a chance to prove themselves.
Chandan Chaturvedi: I understand what you're saying, but I also think that we need to be cautious about the risks of hiring someone because of their caste.
Mohit Sharma: I understand that as well. But I think we need to balance that with the risks of not hiring someone because of their caste.

Aditya Bhatt: I'm a little concerned that he's a Dalit. I'm not sure how much we value someone who isn't a Brahmin.
Chandan Chaturvedi: I understand your concern, but the thing is, a Dalit isn't just a person who isn't a Brahmin. A Dalit is a person who belongs to a lower caste.
Aditya Bhatt: I'm not sure if I understand what you mean.
Chandan Chaturvedi: A Dalit is someone who has been treated as a lower caste for centuries. A Dalit is someone who has faced discrimination and oppression. A Dalit is someone who has been denied basic rights and opportunities.
Aditya Bhatt: I see your point, but I'm not sure if we should value someone based on their caste.
Chandan Chaturvedi: I think it's important to recognize the historical significance of caste. Caste is a social system that has been around for thousands of years, and it's been used to oppress certain groups of people.
Aditya Bhatt: I understand your point, but I'm not sure if it's fair to judge someone based on their caste.
Chandan Chaturvedi: I understand that, but the thing is, caste affects a person's life in many ways. For example, Dalits have faced discrimination in the education system, in the workplace, and in their access to health care.
Aditya Bhatt: I see your point, and I understand why you're concerned. I think we should give Dalits a chance to prove themselves, just like we would any other applicant.
Chandan Chaturvedi: I agree, and I think we should also recognize the importance of an education for everyone. Education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and discrimination.
Aditya Bhatt: I couldn't agree more.

John Clark: I agree, but I’m not sure if that’s specific to Black teachers, or if it’s a general trait.

John Clark: That’s an interesting theory, but I’m still curious about how that would affect a student’s learning.
